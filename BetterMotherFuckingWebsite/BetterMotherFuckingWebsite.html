            <h1>MotherFuckingWebsite.</h1>
            <h3>And it's fucking perfect.</h3>
            <h1>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h1>
            <p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top<br>corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
                <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
                <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
                <li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
                <li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>    
            </ul>
            <h1>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h1>
            <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you <br> need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit?<br> You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker<br>jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind <br> people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit. </p>
            <p> You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
            <h1>It's fucking lightweight</h1>
            <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking<br>means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't<br>care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p>
            <h1>It fucking works</h1>
            <p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has <br> motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what <br> the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>
            <p> It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble <br> account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show <br>me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
            <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>
            <h1>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h1>
            <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you <br> have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic <br> bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked <br> website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>
            <h1>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h1>
            <p> I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the <br> problems we have with websites are ones we create ourselves. Websites aren't broken by <br> default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-<br>bitch.</p>

                From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above, txti was created. You should try it today to <br> make your own motherfucking websites.
