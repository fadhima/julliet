<h1><i>The best motherfucking website</i></h1>
<h2>For real.</h2>
<h1><strong>Styling?</strong></h1>
<p>You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You think <br> your 4.99KB motherfuckingwebsite(.com) is going to get you some award to put <br> on your damn footer as a link. You think your default font is gonna make your <br> website run even on a toaster.</p>
<p>Well, guess what, you're <Font color="red"><u>WRONG</u></Font>, motherfucker.</p>
<h1>The best kick-ass website</h1>
<p> Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <Font color="red"><u>motherfuckingwebsites:</u></Font></p>
<ul>
    <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
    <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <Font color="red"><u>Google home page<u></Font></li>
    <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen although it doesn't work on your 16x32 Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)</li>
    
</ul>
